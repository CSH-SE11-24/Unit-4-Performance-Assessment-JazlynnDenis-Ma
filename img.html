Was looking for a new Chinese good spot since my old one got sold. We are so happy and surprised at quality of food and the great service. We have already order 4 times since we dividers it a month and half ago..we usually only do Chinese once in a while but food was so good, we just kept coming back . The chef and front staff are very nice, which isn't the case in alot of Chinese spots I visited in the past.

Best Chinese spot in the area, compared to the other Chinese restaurants.

I went to this restaurant because the regular place I normally go to wasn’t open. To my delight this place was great! The young adults who worked there were respectable and courteous (which I love), plus the curb appeal and interior was very clean.  I ordered beef and broccoli with extra sauce and to my surprise the chef actually made it the way I wanted. On top of everything else the food tasted really good, and the sauce he made had a very good flavor! Since my first visit I find myself coming back regularly. I think I found my new favorite place! Now it’s time to explore new dishes!
