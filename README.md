Bootstrap made my coding experience way easier, i was able to change and add components quickly.

I didnt exactly follow my MVP because i found the store i picked to challenging to promote

Im proud of my home page because i fell like its very aesthetic and matches the theme of the logo

I think i would add another page dedicated to their culture if i had the time.
